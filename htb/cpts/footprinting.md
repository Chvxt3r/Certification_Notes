# Intro
## Methodology
### Enumeration Layers
|Level|Layers|
|-----|------|
|`Infrastructure`|Internet Presence, Gateway|
|`Host-Based`|Accessible Services, Processes|
|`OS-Based`|Privileges, OS Setup|
### 6 Layers of Footprinting
|Layer|Description|Information Categories|
|-----|-----------|----------------------|
|`1. Internet Presence`|Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.|Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures|
|`2. Gateway`|Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure.|Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare|
|`3. Accessible Services`|Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.|Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface|
|`4. Processes`|Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.|PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination|
|`5. Privileges`|Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.|Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment|
|`6. OS Setup`|	Identification of the internal components and systems setup.|OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files|

* Internet Presence: Identify all possible targets and interfaces that can be tested.
* Gateway: Understand what we are dealing with and what we have to watch out for.
* Accessible Services: Understand the reason and functionality of the target and how to communicate with and exploit it.
* Processes: Understand the processes running on the machine and the dependencies between them.
* Priviliges: Identify and understand what and what is not possible with a given set of priviliges.
* OS Setup: Understand how the admin's manage the environment and what useful/sensitive information we can get from them.

# Infrastructure Based Enumeration
## Domain Information
### Get an understanding of the company and it's services
* What does the company do?
* What technologies does the target company employ to accomplish it's mission?
* 
### Online Presence
> Online presense can include the website, DNS records, basically any available information regarding the target's infrastructure.  
* Review the actual certificate in your browser.
* [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) - Review the `SSL Cert` for the domain.
```bash
# Quickly get and filter out just the subdomains from a crt.sh query.
curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq . | grep name | cut -d":" -f2 | grep -v "CN=" | cut -d'"' -f2 | awk '{gsub(/\\n/,"\n");}1;' | sort -u
```
* Look for company-hosted servers.
```bash
# We can use our list from the previous step
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done
```
* Gathering info with [shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)(Requires an API key)
```bash
# Reduce our list to just company hosted servers
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
# Run our new list through Shodan to get more info
for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done
```
* DNS Records
```bash
dig any [domain]
```
## Cloud Resources
### Google Dorks for cloud resources
* Google searchs of `inurl:` and `intext:`
* Amazon - `intext:[search term] inurl:amazonaws.com`
* Azure - `intext:[search term] inurl:blob.core.windows.net`
### Code Review
* Review the code of the website and any downloadable files for pointers to cloud storage
### [GrayHatWarfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/)
* useful for search AWS/Azure/Google buckets and their contents
* make sure to search for credentials (SSH keys, admin portals, etc)
## Staff
### LinkedIn
* Review job posting to learn about infrastructure
* Review photo's for badge information and inadvertant information disclosure on screens, TV's, Signs, etc.
### Github
* If you can track down an employee or company github, review the code for emails, JWT tokens, SSH keys, etc.
# Host Based Enumeration
## FTP
* Check for anonymous sessions
* Active - Client initiates the connection on port 21 and then informs the sever which port to reply on.
* Passive - Server advertises the port the client should connect on (Great for firewall evasion)
### TFTP
* Provides simple transfer of files
* Does not provide any kind of client authentication
* TFTP does not have a directory list function. 
### Default Configurations
* vsFTPd default settings file
```bash
cat /etc/vsftpd.conf | grep -v "#"
```
* FTPUsers - People in this file are not allowed to use FTP
```bash
cat /etc/ftpusers
```
### Dangerous Settings
* Check for these `optional` configuration settings

|`no_anon_password=YES`|Do not ask anonymous for password?|
|`anon_root=/home/username/ftp`|Directory for anonymous.|
|`write_enable=YES`|Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE?|

### FTP Commands

cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).

# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)

## SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
### Summary
* Mail Flow
Client(MUA) -> Submission Agent(MSA) -> Relay(MTA) -> Delivery Agent(MDA) -> Mailbox(POP3/IMAP/ActiveSync/etc)
* Useful Ports
|Port|Protocol|
|----|--------|
|`25`|SMTP(Uncencrypted) - Open Relay and no user authentication supported|
|'465`|Legacy Secure SMTP|
|`587`|SMTP Submission Default (Supports StartTLS|
### Default Configuration
```bash
cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"

smtpd_banner = ESMTP Server 
biff = no
append_dot_mydomain = no
readme_directory = no
compatibility_level = 2
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
myhostname = mail1.inlanefreight.htb
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost 
masquerade_domains = $myhostname
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 10.129.0.0/16
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
smtp_bind_address = 0.0.0.0
inet_protocols = ipv4
smtpd_helo_restrictions = reject_invalid_hostname
home_mailbox = /home/postfix
```
### SMTP Commands
|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|`AUTH PLAIN`|AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.|
|`HELO`|The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.|
|`MAIL FROM`|The client names the email sender.|
|`RCPT TO`|The client names the email recipient.|
|`DATA`|The client initiates the transmission of the email.|
|`RSET`|The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server.|
|`VRFY`|The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.|
|`EXPN`|The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.|
|`NOOP`|The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.|
|`QUIT`|The client terminates the session.|
### Using Telnet to interact with SMTP
```bash

## SNMP
> `Simple Network Management Protocol` (SNMP)   

|Port|Usage|
|----|-----|
|`161`|Control Commands|
|`162`|Traps|
- MIB's (`Management Information Base`) are used to store device information. These are usually provided by the manufacturere and are a heirarchy of where to find information using `OID`'s(`OBject Identifier`)
- OID's represents a node in a namespace. OIB's and MIB's can be looked up in the [Object Identifier Registry](https://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/)
- Community Strings are basically passwords that determine whether requested info can be viewed or not. 
### Default Configuration
- SNMP Daemon
```bash
cat /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

sysLocation    Sitting on the Dock of the Bay
sysContact     Me <me@example.org>
sysServices    72
master  agentx
agentaddress  127.0.0.1,[::1]
view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1
view   systemonly  included   .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1
rocommunity  public default -V systemonly
rocommunity6 public default -V systemonly
rouser authPrivUser authpriv -V systemonly
```
### Dangerous Settings
|Setting|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|`rwuser noauth`|Provides access to the full OID tree without authentication.|
|`rwcommunity <community string> <IPv4 address>`|Provides access to the full OID tree regardless of where the requests were sent from.|
|`rwcommunity6 <community string> <IPv6 address>`|Same access as with `rwcommunity` with the difference of using IPv6.|
