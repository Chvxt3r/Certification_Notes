# Summary
`Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)` can be described as the act of examining network traffic to characterize common ports and protocols utilized, establish a baseline for our environment, monitor and respond to threats, and ensure the greatest possible insight into our organization's network.

# Analysis
## Summary
Traffic Analysis is a `detailed examination of an event or process`, determining its origin and impact, which can be used to trigger specific precautions and/or actions to support or prevent future occurrences. With network traffic, this means breaking down the data into understandable chunks, examining it for anything that deviates from regular network traffic, for potentially malicious traffic such as unauthorized remote communications from the internet over RDP, SSH, or Telnet, or unique instances preceding network issues. While performing our analysis, we are also looking to see what the trends look like within the traffic and determine if it matches a baseline of typical operational traffic.
