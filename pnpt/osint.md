# Sock Puppets
## Summary
A sock puppet is an online identity that is a deliberate mis-representation of you. Think fake accounts, alternate identities, etc. The whole point is not to draw attention back to yourself. Ideally, we don't want anyone to know that we are looking in to them.

## Search Engine Operators
### Basic Search
- **Combine terms.** For example, search for Harvard CS101, and then refine search results. This will show all results that contain "Harvard" and "CS101" in any order
- **Combine terms in a specific Order** - Enclosing the term's in quotes will search for that specific order. Example `"Harvard CS101"`
- **`:site` Operator** - Search a specific site. For example: `Harvard CS101 site:reddit.com`
- **`AND` Operator** - Search's any site for both terms, not in any particular order
- **`OR` Operator** - Site contains either of the search terms.
- **Wildcards** - We can use the `*` as a wildcard for part of a word
- **filetype** - Use it to search files available on the internet. Example: `site:tesla.com password filetype:xlsx`
- **Subtract results** - Use the `-` operator to remove something from search
- **`intext:`** - Search the text of available documents for a string. Example: `site:twitter.com "Chvxt3r" intext:password`
- **`inurl:`** - Search for text that appears in the url
- **`intitle:`** - Search the title of pages.
- **[Google Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search)** - Useful if you can't remember an operator. Can also limit time.
